# Hi, I’m Yahya (Yaḥyā)

I develop modern machine-learning-based techniques to solve complex computational problems in natural sciences.

I am currently a research and teaching assistant at Universität Hamburg, department of mathematics and the group of Controlled Molecule Imaging (CMI) at the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science CFEL, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY.
